                <h2>About Kick It On Foundation</h2>

                <p>
                    Kick It On Foundation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to expanding access to
                    soccer for underserved youth. Many children face barriers to participation in sports
                    due to the high cost of equipment such as cleats, balls, shin guards, and jerseys.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our mission is to remove those barriers by collecting gently used soccer equipment
                    and redistributing it to children who need it most. By providing access to proper
                    gear, we help young players get on the field, stay active, and experience the
                    confidence, teamwork, and sense of community that soccer offers.
                </p>

                <h3>Who We Support</h3>

                <p>
                    We primarily support underserved youth in Oakland, California, and Jamaica.
                    Many of the children we serve participate in programs such as My Yute Soccer,
                    which provides free soccer camps and programming for players who may not
                    otherwise have access to organized sports.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to supporting young players, we also work closely with coaches,
                    community leaders, and youth organizations that are committed to creating
                    inclusive opportunities for children in their communities.
                </p>

                <h3>Our Approach</h3>

                <p>
                    Kick It On Foundation partners with individuals, teams, schools, and organizations
                    to collect soccer gear and distribute it directly to those in need. Through these
                    partnerships, we are able to reach more players, strengthen local programs, and
                    grow the impact of our mission.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Whether through donating equipment, volunteering time, or partnering with us,
                    supporters play a critical role in helping us ensure that every kid has the chance
                    to play.
