                    <p>
                        Kick It On Foundation is a nonprofit dedicated to expanding access to soccer for children who
                        don’t have the
                        resources to participate. For many young players, the cost of equipment—cleats, balls, shin
                        guards, and
                        jerseys—can be the biggest obstacle to getting on the field.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We close that gap by collecting gently used soccer gear and redistributing it to youth who need
                        it most,
                        partnering with community programs and coaches who serve underserved communities.
                    </p>

                    <p class="small-note">
                        We primarily support youth in Oakland, California and Jamaica, including players involved in
                        programs like
                        My Yute Soccer.
